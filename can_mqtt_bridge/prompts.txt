I need you to write a simple server app in python.
I already have 2 functions:
 * def send_data_to_node(node_id: int, data: bytes) -> None
    ** This function is synchronous and sends data to a node.
    ** The maximum size of data that can be sent with one call is 1024 bytes.
 * def receive_data() -> tuple[int, bytes] # returns (node_id, data)
    ** This function is synchronous and returns the data received from a node.

The Server app should route traffic between these 2 functions and another TCP server.
When we get data from node for the first time we should open a new connection to the TCP server and send the data to it.
When more data comes from the same node we should send it to the existing TCP connection.
When we get data from TCP server through an existing connection we should send it to the corresponding node.
So a list of connections should be maintained that would map node_id to TCP connection.
If we get a disconnect from TCP server we should remove the connection from the list.

Implementation notes:
* User python type annotations
* Note that there is a limit on the size of data that can be sent to a node in one call, so
  if the data is larger than that, we should split it into chunks and send each chunk separately.
* Note that the send_data_to_node and receive_data functions are synchronous,
  so we should use threading to handle the TCP server connections.
* The Server should be implemented as a class that takes another TCP server address and port as parameters.
* Make max send size a constant
